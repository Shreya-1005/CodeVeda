## Features
- **AI-powered Chatbot for Symptom Checking**  
  - Built using **Googleâ€™s Gemini API** for natural, context-aware medical conversations  
  - Analyzes user-reported symptoms and provides responses in a structured format:  
    **Severity**, **Immediate Need for Attention**, **See a Doctor If**, **Next Steps**, **Possible Conditions**  
  - Helps users decide whether they can manage symptoms at home or need to consult a healthcare professional  

- **Nearby Hospitals & Pharmacies**  
  - Interactive map powered by **OpenStreetMap & Overpass API**  
  - Automatically detects your **approximate location** (via IP geolocation)  
  - Displays hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies within a **5 km radius**  
  - Includes a **legend and radius circle** for better clarity  
  - Falls back to prominent Delhi hospitals (AIIMS, Safdarjung, Apollo, Fortis, Apollo Pharmacy and MedPlus Pharmacy) if location detection fails
- **Emergency SOS Button**
  - Quick one-click emergency trigger from the navbar
  - Detects location via GPS or falls back to IP-based lookup
  - Shows a popup with confirmation and a Google Maps link
  - Auto-hides after a few seconds for smooth UX
